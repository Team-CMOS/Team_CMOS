52,This product was tested thoroughly on the street and track on both the 034Motorsport Audi TT RS 2.5 TFSI and Nate@034's Audi A3 before release. The 034Motorsport Adjustable Solid Rear Sway Bar substantially reduces understeer and body roll on the Audi 8J/8P and MkV/MkVI Volkswagen R32 & Golf R without compromising comfort on the street.,0.0
53,"In addition, the 034Motorsport Rear Sway Bar is engineered to be used effectively with the stock front sway bar. No upgrade in the front is needed or required. The addition of a stiffer front bar introduces even more push, requiring an even bigger bar in the back.  With the stock front sway bar and upgraded 034Motorsport Solid Rear Sway Bar, body roll is virtually eliminated while turn in and off throttle oversteer are greatly improved.",0.0
54,"The sway bar rate is adjustable via the adjustment holes. The two holes closest to the MOI of the bar are the ""stiff"" (423% stiffer than stock) setting, and the two holes farther out are the ""soft"" (362% stiffer than stock) setting.",0.0

It has brightened my skin from the inside out! Like a light is shining under my skin to create a soft glow. My pores are smaller, my discoloration is gone, and no breakouts! Fine lines and wrinkles are fading. It goes perfect under my moisturizer. And add makeup on top of that, no problem...it holds up beautifully. Absolute keeper!",1.0

373,"This serum is great. When I use it consistently it changes the texture of my skin, making it very smooth and absolutely youthful. I can’t live without it. It smells fantastic too. My skin gets tiny bumps all over it because of natural oil production, but I notice that when I use this serum consistently along with my normal cleansing routine, it really helps with the texture. And it’s natural! Whenever there is a good sale, I buy a lot of these serums. I buy a LOT of their products in general, but this serum has been my favorite since day one. This brand is heaven.",1.0

2100,"My wife purchased the Cape Towns for me for Christmas, after I finally got my suspension work done they were finally installed. I love the look and the ride quality is excellent. The only issue was one of the center caps on the staggered set was polished instead of silver but American Muscle took care of that in no time. If you order these without tires, make sure you let your tire installer know that the stainless steel lip is very soft, both my 18X10.5 rear wheels were damaged with dents by the installer during tire installation. Overall I love them.",1.0
